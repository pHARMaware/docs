## Problem Definitions

Rules and moderation should strictly be used to solve problems. Naturally the first step should be defining the problems we can then use rules to solve:

1. Mitigate things that make drugs more accessible (eg: online vending) which can accelerate a user's escalation of use.
1. General escalation of drug use via normalization of absurd drug use.
1. Stop user's from being a danger (doxxing, darastic, mental distress).
1. Propogation of incorrect, dangerous, or misrepresented advice.
1. Curate a safe place for users of any drug where people aren't going to be attacked for their drug use.


## Proposed Rules

These rules are provided as a guildeline for the pHARMassist moderation team to solve problems. Do not try to lawyer your way out of complying with a staff request. Generally if you simply try your best to cooperate with staff you'll be fine.

### General
1. Be 18 years of age or older. 
1. Do not provide any sources to drugs, under the widest of definitions regardless of legality. This includes discussion of online drug markets and TOR, and TailsOS at all.
1. Do not announce the use of drugs or prompt the use of drugs.

### Voice &amp; Video Chat
1. Substances and parapheniallia should not be shown on camera.
